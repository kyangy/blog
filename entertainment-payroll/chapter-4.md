# Hiring an insurance broker

You will need an insurance broker to get a production insurance policy. You can buy production insurance on a website or in person. You can only have one broker at a time. 

Choosing the right broker is critical. Your policy and rate is only as good as the agent securing it. You need someone you can trust when problems arise. 

Remember, you will want an entertainment insurance broker. You will need someone who specializes in entertainment or production policies.

Entertainment insurance brokers understand production policies. They will know how to to give you the most coverage at the best rate. 

If your broker advertises renter or auto insurance, they are most likely not an entertainment insurance broker.

## Talking to the Entertainment Insurance Broker

First off, make sure you have all the details regarding your production(s). Explain to the broker on how your production company functions. Tell them what kind(s) of project you are producing.

Example: If you have animals, get animal-specific insurance. If you have explosions, get life insurance policy. 

Make sure you are covered for all the potential activities of your film. If something bad happens and you are not covered, the costs will be exponentially higher.
