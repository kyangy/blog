# What is Production Insurance?

Film production insurance protects your production company or project from liability. The needs of every production are different. Each policy is tailored to the demands of the production at the time of purchase. Production companies are team companies. You want to make sure your team is protected.

For a production company, buying an annual insurance policy may be a great idea. For a project, buying a short term film production policy is an excellent idea. A good policy protects the producer from liability related to injuries and accidents. Getting coverage for theft or loss and damage for rental equipment is handy. You can even get a policy that protects the production from libel. 

> If you are a producer on set, you carry an enormous responsibility. This can mean serious financial, legal, or criminal consequences to you.

## What’s the difference between short-term or annual production insurance?

Short-term policy covers you on a project basis. It can cover you on a single day of production or more.

Annual policy covers you if you are shooting all year-round.  You can cover all your projects at once. This policy if used by active production companies.

It’s usually a good idea to get a quote for both short-term and annual policies. The difference in price is marginal when you have coverage all year round.

**Rule of thumb for annual policy:**

you have an active production company
you own equipment that you rent to productions
you are a producer with 4+ productions a year
you are producing an indie

Both short term and annual insurance cost a few thousand dollars, at minimum. You should budget around 2.5% of your total production for video production insurance.

## Coverage areas

Coverage area is the location where your insurance policy takes effect. For short term insurance, just opt for coverage where your shoot is happening. 

For annual policies, make sure you are covered in all your shoot locations. A domestic policy (US) will work in the states, but not internationally. You will need to purchase international coverage if you are planning on shooting abroad.

## Deductibles

Most film production insurance deductible starts at $2500. This means that if your claim is under $2500, it’s probably not worth the claim. The lower the deductible, the more expensive the policy.
