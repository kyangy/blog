# Budgeting for Payroll

Budgeting for payroll is different than budgeting for 1099 contractor services.  You need to consider employer taxes, workersâ€™ compensation rates, and union fringes.

You will need to consider the cost of the payroll service. Every payroll company charges differently for their services. All payroll companies charge a percentage of total payroll. 

> At [Topsheet](https://topsheet.io) we always charge one flat rate for processing payroll for all project types, [2%](https://topsheet.io/pricing).

> Some companies will charge additional fees for certain items. They may charge a fee for audit reports. They may charge a fee per mistake. They may also charge a fee per check.
