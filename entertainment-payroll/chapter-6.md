# Budgeting for Payroll

Budgeting for payroll is different than budgeting for 1099 contractor services.  You need to consider employer taxes, workersâ€™ compensation rates, and union fringes.

You will need to consider the cost of the payroll service. Every payroll company charges differently for their services. All payroll companies charge a percentage of total payroll. 

For union employees, consider the negotiated union minimum rate per union employee. You will need to pay a guaranteed amount of hours or days per position. 

> You can use our [Union Rates Search](https://topsheet.io/union-rates-search) to help with getting union minimums and guaranteed hours.

For non-union employees, you will need to consider local minimum wage. This may differ from states, counties, and cities. 

> At [Topsheet](https://topsheet.io) we always charge one flat rate for processing payroll for all project types, [2%](https://topsheet.io/pricing).

> Some companies will charge additional fees for certain items. They may charge a fee for audit reports. They may charge a fee per mistake. They may also charge a fee per check.
