# Budgeting for Payroll

Budgeting for payroll is different than budgeting for 1099 contractor services.  You need to consider employer taxes, workers’ compensation rates, and union fringes.

You will need to consider the cost of the payroll service. Every payroll company charges differently for their services. All payroll companies charge a percentage of total payroll.

> Some companies will charge additional fees for certain items. They may charge a fee for audit reports. They may charge a fee per mistake. They may also charge a fee per check. 

> At [Topsheet](https://topsheet.io), we always only charge one flat rate of 2% there are no added fees of any kind.
