### [New York Film Academy](https://www.nyfa.edu/los-angeles/)
Undergrad Tuition: $38,779
Admission Rate: N/A
Graduation Rate: 97%

The New York Film Academy is based out of New York, but they do have a campus located in North Hollywood near Universal Studios. They do take a hands on approach in their film education, which is what you want to do in film school, but having not attended this school and struggling to find too much information online, I can’t necessarily recommend them. Instead, I recommend visiting the campus to ask questions and determine whether or not it’s a good fit for you. Keep in mind, the best experience in this industry is hands on, so if you choose this school, or any school,,,, make as many films as you can.

### [California State University- Northridge](https://www.csun.edu/mike-curb-arts-media-communication/cinema-television-arts)
Undergrad Tuition: $6,875
Admission Rate: 48%
Graduation Rate: 50%

I like Northridge, as a city. It’s not so chaotic, like downtown LA and the living expenses are much more affordable. As far as CSUN, it’s definitely not a top of the line education, but the price is right and it is a good foot in the door. Especially if you aren’t 100% sold on getting into the film industry. The cost of this school is probably it’s biggest draw to someone considering their options. Also, make a lot of student films using the school’s equipment and resources and take advantage of your student discount on software and other products.


### [Emerson College, Los Angeles, CA](http://www2.emerson.edu/ela)
Undergrad Tuition: $41,052
Admission Rate: 48%
Graduation Rate: 80%


This is a relatively new school, opening in 2014, and being such a young school, it’s unclear whether or not it’s worth the tuition cost. I guess time will tell. They do boast a state of the art campus with all the best equipment. We will see if their tech can keep up with the always upgrading and advancing film industry. 

### [Loyola Marymount University, Los Angeles, CA](https://sftv.lmu.edu)
Undergrad Tuition: $46,136
Admission Rate: 54%
Graduation Rate: 83%


Loyola is a good film school, they teach all the right stuff. But the thing that stands out is their Incubator Lab, which operates in partnership with Film Independent as a non-profit arts organization designed to help emerging professional filmmakers receive mentorship on their projects and free access to industry studios. 

### [Art Center College of Design, Pasadena](http://www.artcenter.edu/academics/undergraduate-degrees/film/overview.html)
Undergrad Tuition: $41,408
Acceptance Rate: 69%
Graduation Rate: 73%

As you can probably guess by the name, this school relies heavily on the “arts”. Their film program is not their main draw. You’ll probably find some very interesting, creatively brilliant people here, but if film education is your goal, probably go somewhere else and then look up the artsy fartsy alumni from this school to make your visually captivating films. 

### [Chapman University, Orange County, CA](https://www.chapman.edu/campus-services/career-professional-development/explore/film-production.aspx)
Undergrad Tuition: $52,340
Admission Rate: 54%
Graduation Rate: 79%

Chapman has a nice campus and is away from the stress of Hollywood, but they're kind of, really away. Which is a fairly significant con, given the fact that networking makes the film-world go ‘round. They do, however, have a great teacher-student ratio.

### [Biola University, La Miranda, CA](https://www.biola.edu/film)
Undergrad Tuition: $36,696
Admission Rate: 64.9%
Graduation Rate: 68.9%

Biola is a private school that has recently been ranked in the top 40 for film schools. Students are provided 24-hour access to a 10,000 square-foot production center complete with sound stage, recording room, and video and audio editing facilities. For a private school, the tuition isn’t all that outrageou and having access to their production may, by itself, be worth it.

### [California Institute of the Arts](https://calarts.edu)
Undergrad Tuition: $48,660
Admission Rate: 24%
Graduation Rate: 66%

California Institute of the Arts specializes in the field and provides a well-rounded education in drawing, storyboarding, and digital animation. Alumni include countless employees at animation studios like Disney, Pixar, and Illumination as well as Hollywood legends like Tim Burton and John Lasseter. As far as traditional film school, they are still a strong contender and have quality programs across the board.

### [University of California, Los Angeles](http://www.tft.ucla.edu)
Undergrad Tuition: $13,260 (CA resident)
Admission Rate: 11%
Graduation Rate: 91%

Statistically, UCLA has one of the best film programs out there. All around, they are a great school, but particularly in “in front of the camera” areas. Cost to effectiveness ratio… This probably takes the cake.

### [American Film Institute Conservatory](https://conservatory.afi.com)
Undergrad Tuition: $51,360 (two years)
Admission Rate: 32%
Graduation Rate: N/A

AFI is a “no nonsense” school. They have a great rating and a lot of their graduates seem to get work shortly after graduating, but they don’t seem to offer the usual “college” experience of parties and football games. 

### [University of Southern California](https://cinema.usc.edu)
Undergrad Tuition: $53,448
Admission Rate: 5%
Graduation Rate: 91%

USC is the most expensive school and the hardest to get into (more difficult than Harvard), for good reason, apparently. They have the nicest campus, the best facilities, the latest gear, the strongest alumni network and the most celebrity professors and their stingy with who they share it with. No doubt, this is a tough school, but your chances of a successful career following graduation is pretty high.

### Final Thoughts
There are a lot of options and pros and cons to each of these options, so take your time and weigh them out carefully before you make your decision. Keep in mind, the only way to ensure you have work after school is to make connections and build your resume. Nepotism is the lifeblood of this industry. You may want to consider going to a sub par school that allows you the time and financial freedom to go to film festivals to rub shoulders with the right people. Whatever you do, work hard, keep a good attitude and make as many films as you can.
