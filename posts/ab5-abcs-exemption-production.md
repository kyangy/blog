With the AB5 bill weeks away from being implemented, in January, we should take a minute to break the ABCs down a little further, checking if your production company is exempt from this law.  Let’s start by wrapping our minds around the intention that the CA Supreme Court has, which is basically setting the default as: crew members are employees, unless you can prove, irrefutably, you are a contractor, thereby protecting employees from companies exploiting loopholes in the law. Making it  intentionally difficult to be classified as an independent contractor status. I believe the goal is two-fold: 1) some people have been getting screwed over because of some companies insisting the people they hire be independent contractors and they aren’t being treated well , 2) the massive tax revenue that will be achieved (an estimated 8 billion dollars). It’s the classic, “one disruptive kid ruins the class party for everyone and the teacher eats all the marshmallows in the jar” situation. 

If you haven’t yet, read our article on the [essentials of the AB5 law](https://topsheet.io/blog/everything-productions-need-to-know-ab5-law), as it gives a good overview of how this affects you, as a filmmaker, and what options you have to overcome this disruptive bill. It’s a serious pain in the butt because so many people working in film prefer to work as 1099, but almost everyone will have to become an employee, so the transition is massive. But you’re not in this alone, we are here to help. Topsheet is an entertainment payroll app that automates the process so you don’t have to hire an outside payroll company to handle all of this. We can save you days or weeks of work, depending on the size of your production, saving you tons of time and, therefore, money.

### The ABCs of the ABCs

As a recap, the ABCs are what the state now recognizes as the definition of “independent contractor”. All three of these instances must be met in order to be considered an independent contractor. If one of these factors is missing, the person hired must be an employee. It’s a very broad net.

A) The worker is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity in connection with the performance of the work, both under the contract for the performance of the work and in fact.

B) The worker performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity’s business.

C) The worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as the work performed.
> Example: Kraft Services would likely be an employee because they are under the control and direction of the hiring entity. They are told when and where and how to perform their job. Krafty is on every set, so it is a usual course of the hiring entity’s business and they don’t work outside the entertainment industry.
	Hiring a chef would probably fall under the “employee” category because they are under the control and direction of the hiring entity. Their hours are controlled as well as the type of food prepared and the time frame in which it is prepared.
	Hiring a Catering company, can be in the independent contractor category because they are not under the control or direction of the hiring entity. They set their hours and their wages. Caterers have an off-site kitchen and they have their own established business.

### But That’s Not All, Folks.

Prior to the ABC test, there was the Borello test which considers the employer’s “right to control work details”. Under the right-of-control test it is, “not how much control a hirer exercises, but how much control the hirer retains the right to exercise.” Based on the verbiage, most assume that employers must comply with both the ABC test and the Borello test. The Borello test factors are as follows:

1)Whether the one performing services is engaged in a distinct occupation or business;

2)The kind of occupation, with reference to whether, in the locality, the work is usually done under the direction of the principal or by a specialist without supervision;

3)The skill required in the particular occupation;

4)Whether the principal or the worker supplies the instrumentalities, tools, and the place of work for the person doing the work;

5)The length of time for which the services are to be performed;

6)The method of payment, whether by the time or by the job;

7)Whether or not the work is part of the regular business or the principal; and

8)Whether or not the parties believe they are creating the relationship of employer-employee.

Additionally, the Borello test borrows 5 more factors from the Fair Labor Standards Act to determine a worker’s classification:

9)The alleged employee’s opportunity for profit or loss depending on his managerial skill;

10)The alleged employee’s investment in equipment or materials required for his task, or his employment of helpers;

11)Whether the service rendered requires a special skill;

12)The degree of permanence of the working relationship; and

13)Whether the service rendered is an integral part of the alleged employer’s business.

### Final Thoughts

Here’s what this all boils down to: the people you need to work with to make your film are employees now and if you have specific questions, talk to a lawyer, to find out for sure, to avoid fines or potential jail time. This law is broad on purpose, so finding loopholes will be really tricky at best, but probably impossible. Please, please, please, err on the side of caution and consult a lawyer.
